# Validation record

Prepared on 2026-10-04 against the laptop's installed Omarchy 4.0.0.alpha.

- `omarchy plugin validate .`: passed.
- Bash syntax checks for bundled scripts: passed.
- Source scan: no access tokens, refresh tokens, private keys, or machine-specific home paths detected in non-documentation source.
- QML lint completed with warnings. The tool was given an import root mapping `qs` to the installed Omarchy shell. Warnings include Quickshell process signal metadata and, for inherited panels/views, dynamic properties. This is not a clean semantic-lint result.
- Stopped-service status produces valid JSON with nonempty display text and a not-mounted tooltip. No Google login, live mount, or cloud writes were tested.

No publishing copy was installed into the active desktop. No runtime lock/display changes were made. Current-stable compatibility, fresh-account installation/removal, visual preview, and the repository's RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md remain required before a supported release.
